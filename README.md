> Turn generated changes into owned changes

Open a change, leave findings and todos, and prepare a repair plan
for the agent.

```text
Review → Plan → Repair → Verify
```

- Review uncommitted git diffs, a given commit, a GitHub PR, or a GitLab MR.
- Stage, unstage, or revert each contiguous block of diff lines.
- Leave feedback and todos that become a repair plan for the agent.
- Import GitHub PR and GitLab MR review comments into the local plan for AI.
- Review each npm dependency once across `package.json` and the lockfile.
- Propose unused removals, npm audit fixes, and outdated updates as diffs.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g reslop
```

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. On Windows use Windows Terminal.

## Usage

- `reslop` uncommitted diffs in this repository
- `reslop path/file` show only that path or file
- `reslop 7ac260c` show that commit (read-only)
- `reslop https://github.com/metarhia/metacom/pull/555` GitHub/GitLab PR/MR
- `reslop -n` start a new review even if the latest is still editing
- `reslop -r` read-only: no stage, unstage, revert, or npm apply

Reviews go in `.review/YYYY-MM-DD-NN.md` with frontmatter `status`:

- `editing`: still writing the review in reslop
- `ready`: ready for AI to work through the checkboxes
- `partial`: AI started; some items remain
- `done`: all items marked `[x]`
